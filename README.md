## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. The inquiry was based on the employees birth dates ranging from 1952 to 1955 and hired dates from 1985 to 1988.

## Results

* Out of all retiring employees, there are 25,916 Senior Engineers, 24,926 Senior Staff, 9,285 Engineers, 7,636 Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, 1,090 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers. It is important to note that only 2 managers are retiring which is a benefit since these roles might be challenging to fill.

## Summary

In a nutshell, PH will need to fulfill 72,458 positions once the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact. It is crucial to note that there is a big gap between retiring employees and those eligible to participate in a mentorship program which can create further challenges for preparing the next generation of their work force. In order for PH to be better prepared, it would be beneficial to create a report to determine the number of employess reriting at the end of each year.
